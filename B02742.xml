            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

                  <p>There are only one or two things more that are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to be added for the Readers satisfaction. 1.

                  </p>
                  <p>2 That in the last Section <hi>de constitutione Justitiarii,</hi> after the word <hi>censeatur,</hi> there should be added <hi>constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atur Justiclarius per Consilium,</hi> but tho' these defects are observable in the Record, yet I thought it not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient to insert them in their proper places, because I did believe it inconsistent with the integrity of a Transcriber to add or alter any thing in the Original.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. I. <hi>The manner of choosing a Speaker in Parliament.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>THE day the Speaker is chosen, the Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hath been in this manner: Some per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son (when the generality of Members are come and sit) doth put the House in mind, That for their better proceedings in the weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Affairs they are come about, their first work is to appoint a Speaker; and recommends to the House some Person of fitness and ability for that Service and Dignity; which usually hath been one of the long Robe. If the House generally give a Testimony of their Approbation, two of the Members (which for the most part were of the Council or Chief Officers of the Court) going to the Gentleman named, and agreed to be Speaker, take him from his place, and lead him unto the Chair, where being set, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to their places.</p>
                  <p>If more then one person be named for Speaker, and it be doubtful who is more generally chosen; sometimes one of the Members standing in his place, doth by direction or leave of the House, put a que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion for determining the same.</p>
                  <p>In the first Session of the Parliament 1<seg rend="sup">o</seg>
                     <hi>Jacobi,</hi> Sir <hi>Edward Phelips,</hi> the Kings Serjeant at Law was first named by Mr. Secretary <hi>Herbert,</hi> as fit for that place, in regard of his Knowledge of the Laws, the gift of Utterance, his long experience and Practice in Parliament; after some silence, the names of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers were mentioned, but the more general voice ran upon Sir <hi>Edward Phelips,</hi> who thereupon stood
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:175662:16"/> up, and made a Speech to excuse and disable himself; but the House, notwithstanding his excuse, was wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to proceed to a Question, and directed the Clerk sitting at the Board (as the Order is before the Speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er be chosen, so it is entred in the Journal of that Session) to make the Question upon his name, <hi>viz. All that will have Sir</hi> Edward Phelips <hi>Speaker, say, Yea, &amp;c.</hi> Which done, and he being by general Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation chosen Speaker, he was by Sir <hi>John Herbert</hi> and Sir <hi>Edward Stafford</hi> (leading him as the form is) placed in the Chair, the antient Seat of Speakers: where being set. after some silence he stood up and made a gratulatory Speech of Form and Thanks.</p>
                  <p>The first business in the House is ordinarily to read a Bill that was not passed in the last Parliament preceeding, or some new Bill; as in that of 1<seg rend="sup">o</seg>
                     <hi>Jaco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bi,</hi> a new Bill, Entituled, <hi>Touching Common Recoveries against Infants,</hi> was read.</p>
                  <p>But on that day before that was done, there was a Motion made for Priviledge of Sir <hi>Thomas Shirley,</hi> who was chosen a Member to serve in that Parliament, but detained by an Arrest; upon which a <hi>Habeas cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus</hi> was awarded, and the Serjeant that Arrested him and his Yeoman sent for, and a Committee for Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and Priviledges chosen.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. II. <hi>Decorum to be observed in the House.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>WHen the Speaker is set in his Chair, every Member is to sit in his place with his head covered.</p>
                  <p>No Member in coming into the House, or in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving from his place, is to pass between the Speaker and any Member then speaking; nor may cross or go
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:175662:16"/> ovetrhwart the House; or pass from one side to the other while the House is sitting.</p>
                  <p>No Member is to come into the House with his Head covered, nor to remove from one place to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with his Hat on, nor is to put on his Hat in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in or removing, untill he be sat down in his place.</p>
                  <p>While the House is sitting, no mân ought to speak or whisper to another, to the end the House may not be interrupted when any are speaking; but eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one is to attend unto what is spoken. In which Case, Penalties have been imposed; as 4. <hi>Decem.</hi> 1640 and at other times.</p>
                  <p>When any Member intends to speak, he is to stand up in his place uncovered, and address himself to the Speaker, who usually calls such person by his name, that the House may take notice who it is that speaks.</p>
                  <p>If more then one stand up at once, the Speaker is to determine who was first up, and he is to speak, and the other sit down, unless he who was first up sit down again, and give way to the other, or that some, other Member stand up and acquaint the House, that another was up before him, whom the Speaker calls and the House adjudge it so.</p>
                  <p>While one is speaking none else is to stand up or interrupt him untill he have done speaking and be sat down, and then any other may rise up and speak, observing the Rules.</p>
                  <p>21. <hi>Junii,</hi> 1604. It was agreed for an Order, <hi>That when Mr. Speaker desires to speak, he ought to be heard without Interruption, if the House be silent and not in dispute.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>12 <hi>Jacobi,</hi> It was vouched by Sir <hi>Dudley Diggs,</hi> (a person of much experience in Parliaments) <hi>That when the Speaker stands up, the Member standing up ought to sit down.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>27 <hi>April,</hi> 1604. Agreed for a Rule, <hi>That if any Question be upon a Bill, the Speaker is to explain,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:175662:17"/> but not to sway the House with Argument or Dispute,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>June</hi> 4, 1604. Agreed for an Order, <hi>That who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever hisseth or disturbeth any Man in his Speech, shall answer it at the Bar.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>7. <hi>Maii,</hi> 1607. Ordered upon the Question, <hi>That in going forth, no Man should stir untill Mr. Speaker do arise and go before, and then all the rest to follow after him.</hi>

                  <head>CHAP. IV. <hi>Power and proceedings of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee for Priviledges.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>BUt the Committee for Priviledges and Elections hath alway had the preceedence of all other Committees, being commonly the first Committee appointed, and ordinarily the first first day after, or the same day the Speaker did take his place.</p>
                  <p>This Committee is constituted of particular Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers named by the House.</p>
                  <p>21 <hi>Jacobi.</hi> Upon naming a Committee for Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges and Elections, a Motion was made, That all that come should have Voices: but Sir <hi>Thomas Creu</hi> then Speaker (and well versed in Rules of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) minded the House, That by the Orders of the House, that was not to be done; and by divers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Members, it was insisted on, to be contrary to all former Precedents; yet upon the Debate a Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion was put, Whether all that should come should have voices at that Committee; and it passed in the Negative. And another Question being put, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the persons nominated only should be of that Committee; it was resolved in the Affirmative.</p>
                  <p>It was then also agreed, That <hi>Council should be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted at that Committee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Power anciently given to this Committee, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by the Entry in the Journal Book 26 <hi>Feb.</hi> 1600. in 39. <hi>Eliz. That this Committee should, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring all that present sitting of Parliament, examine and make report of all such Cases touching the Elections and Returns of any the Knights, Citizens, Burgesses and Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons of the House.</hi> And also, <hi>of all such Cases for Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges, as in any wise may occurr or fall out during all the same Session of Parliament; to the end, the House up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:175662:18"/> Report of the same Examinations, might proceed to such further Course in every the same Cases as shall be thought fit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And notice was given, That all the Members of the House might repair thither as there should be cause.</p>
                  <p>This later Power touching Priviledge seems to have been inserted to prevent the Houses being trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with Informations, untill they were examined and ripe for a Determination.</p>
                  <p>But in other Parliaments, both before and since, that Power doth not appear to have been given them so absolutely; but matters of Priviledge were, upon Information to the House, there heard, and not in a Committee, unless in some special Cases, wherein there was cause of Examination, or of some prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Charge; as in Case of <hi>Smaley, 23 Eliz.</hi> and many other Cases.</p>
                  <p>The Power of this Committee usually was, as it is entered 6 <hi>November, 1640. To examine and consider all Questions which shall grow and arise in that Parliament about Elections, Returns and other Priviledges.</hi> Or, as in the Parliament 1<seg rend="sup">o</seg>
                     <hi>Jacobi,</hi> thus: <hi>This Committee are to examine all matters questionable touching Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges and Returns, and to acquaint the House with their proceedings, from time to time, so, as Order may be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken according to the occasion, and agreeable to ancient Custom and Precedent.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And to the end these Questions might be speedily determined: and the House might know their Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, Days are usually assigned, beyond which there shall be no questioning a former Election.</p>
                  <p>So in the Parliament of 21 <hi>Jacobi,</hi> the second day of sitting, It was Ordered, <hi>That all Petitions about Elections and Returns should be preferred to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee of Priviledges within a Fortnight from that Day, or else to be silenced for that Session.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>16. <hi>April.</hi> 1640. Ordered, <hi>that those who would
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:175662:18"/> question Elections should do it within Ten days by Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>6. <hi>Novemb.</hi> 1640. Ordered, <hi>That all such as will question Elections now returned, should do it in Fourteen days and so within 14 days after any new Return.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Some questions have been, where there have been double Indentures returned for several persons for the same place, whether all or any, or which of them should sit.</p>
                  <p>The general rule and practice hath been in such case, That neither one nor other should sit in the House, until it were either decided or Ordered by the House: Therefore in <hi>April</hi> 1640. the Lord High Steward, who had power by himself or his Deputies, to minister the Oaths of Supremacy and Allegiance to all Members returned, before they sat in the House, gave Order, That where there were more returned for any one place then ought to be, there should be none of them sworn till it were decided by the House who were duely Elected. But that which may satisfie herein, is the Order of the House in that Parliament, that if any sit in the House, that are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned by more Indentures then usual, they should withdraw till the Committee for Priviledges had fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Ordered.</p>
                  <p>In the Parliament begun <hi>April,</hi> 1640. and <hi>Novem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> 1640. It was moved; That where some are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned by the Sheriff or such other Officer, as in Law hath power to Return, and others by private hands; there those returned by the Sheriff or such Officer, should sit till the Election be quashed by the House.</p>
                  <p>But nothing was Ordered upon it.</p>
                  <p>24 <hi>Feb.</hi> 1623. Sir <hi>Francis Popham</hi> being returned a Burgess for <hi>Chippenham</hi> by one Indenture, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther person returned for the same place by another In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denture: it was moved he might be admitted into the House till the matter were determined against him, and a precedent quoted in Sir <hi>Thomas Wentworths</hi>
                     <pb n="10" facs="tcp:175662:19"/> Case the last preceedent Parliament. But it was then insisted on by the Chancellor of the Dutchy and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, That this being a Case of a double Return, he was not to be admitted, and so it was referred to the Committee for Priviledges. His Case being report<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed 9. <hi>April,</hi> he was judged to be duely Elected.</p>
                  <p>21. <hi>Jacobi,</hi> Two Indentures were returned for <hi>Southwark,</hi> the one returned <hi>Yarrow</hi> and <hi>Mingy,</hi> the other <hi>Yarrow</hi> and <hi>Bromfield;</hi> upon a Report from the Committee for Elections, it was resolved, That the Election and Return for <hi>Yarrow</hi> should stand good, and that he should fit in the House.</p>
                  <p>22. <hi>Martii 21. Jacobi,</hi> The House was acquainted that Sir <hi>John Jackson</hi> and Sir <hi>Tho. Beaumont</hi> were both returned for one Burgesses place for <hi>Pomfret;</hi> and therefore it was moved, That both might be sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended till it were determined; Mr. <hi>Glanvill</hi> made answer to that Motion, That he that was return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed might sight in the House until it were deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined; which being contradicted by others, and much Dispute on both sides, it was lastly urged by Sir <hi>Robert Phelips,</hi> That there was not any Prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent for it, and therefore moved the Committee might take the Election into Consideration to<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>morrow, and that in the mean time the parties might forbear to come into the House: which was Ordered accordingly.</p>
                  <p>4 <hi>November.</hi> 1640. Upon a Report from the Committee for Privileges, That several Indentures were returned for Burgesses for the Burrough of <hi>Bos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinny</hi> in the County of <hi>Cornvval,</hi> the one by the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor of the Town, the other promiscuously: The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee were of opinion upon view of the bare In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denture, That Sir <hi>Charles Harbord,</hi> who was return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Major, was well returned; but the House declared he should not sit till the Election were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided.</p>
                  <p>In the same parliament, two Returns were made
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:175662:19"/> for <hi>Marlo Magna,</hi> in both Indentures <hi>John Burlace</hi> Esq; was returned; therefore, upon Report from the Committee, he was admitted to sit, but the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to forbear till the question be determined.</p>
                  <p>17. <hi>April. 19. Jacobi,</hi> It was Ordered, <hi>That no petition should be received by a Committee, but openly at the Committee, and read at the Committee before the party go that preferred it, and the parties name that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred it be subscribed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the parliament in 21 <hi>Jacobi,</hi> upon a Report made from the Committee for Elections and privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, praying the direction of the House, whether Affidavits might be made use of at that Committee.</p>
                  <p>These Reasons being insisted upon, that Affidavits should not be admitted.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Because it makes the parliament lame without the Chancery.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It Entituled the Chancery to judge of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Affidavits are oftentimes cautelously made by Council or parties.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Witnesses produced <hi>Viva voce,</hi> by Words, Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Gestures, or the like, may discover much, whereby the Committee may judge.</p>
                  <p>It was likewise informed by Sir <hi>Edvvard Coke</hi> late Lord Chief Justice, That in the parliament when he was Speaker, which was 35 <hi>Eliz.</hi> Affidavits were not used, nor since, until of late.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Though the Committee examine not an Oath, yet they may punish any that shall testifie untruly: of which an instance was given in the last preceeding parliament in the Case of one <hi>Damport;</hi> It was Resolved, <hi>That all Affidavits to be taken in any Court concerning Elections, Returns, or any thing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending thereupon, should be rejected, and not hereafter to be Used.</hi>

                  <p>IT falling out ordinarily, that one Person is chosen and returned to serve for several places, it is in his Election to make his choice in the House in his own person for what place he will serve, and wave the other Elections so as a writ may go out for a new E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection for such place waved, that the number may be full; but if he shall not do it by the time which the House shall appoint, then it hath been said, the House will appoint for what place such person shall continue a Member, and that Writs may go out for the other places: but <hi>Quaere</hi> whether it hath been done.</p>
                  <p>Oftentimes on the First day of the meeting of the House, as soon as the Speaker hath been approved, and sometimes before, such Persons as have been so doubtly returned have made their choice.</p>
                  <p>In the first Session of Parliament 1. <hi>Jacobi,</hi> the same day Sir <hi>Edward Phelips</hi> was chosen Speaker (before he was presented to the King) he signed a Warrant as Speaker, by command of the House, for Election of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Person in the place of Sir <hi>Francis Bacon</hi> being chosen in two places. And in the same Session, the same day after the Speaker had taken his place, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Members who were severally returned, as elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in several places, made their choise for what places, they would stand, and new Writs ordered.</p>
                  <p>The Parliament beginning the 13. <hi>April</hi> 1640. and the Speaker being presented the 15th, upon the 16th day divers made their choise upon such double Returns.</p>
                  <p>The Parliament beginning the 3. <hi>Novemb.</hi> 1640. Upon a long debate for granting time for Elections on double Returns of this nature, it was resolved <hi>That all such as are doubly returned shall make their choice for which place they will serve on Monday next.</hi>

                  <p>9 <hi>Martii, 21, Jacobi,</hi> Resolved, <hi>That all Members of this House doubly returned, shall make their Election for which they will serve, and that those in the House shall do it presently, or else new Writs to issue for both.</hi>

                  <p>A General Order hath usually been made in the beginning of the Session, to authorize the Speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to give Warrant for new Writs, in case of Death of any Member, or of double Returns. where the party makes his choice openly in the House during that Session; so it was Ordered in the beginning of the Parliaments 18. and 21. <hi>Jacobi.</hi>

                  <p>Where such general Order is not made, Writs have issued by Warrant of the Speaker, by vertue of spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Order, upon Motion in the House.</p>

                  <p>When a Motion hath been made, that Matter must receive a determination by a Question, or be laid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side by the general Sence of the House before another be entertained. An instance is in the Journal 28.

                  <p>If the Matter moved do receive a Debate <hi>pro &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra,</hi> in that Debate none may spake more than once to the Matter, And after time spent in the Debate the Speaker collecting the Sense of the House upon the Debate, is to reduce the same into a Question, which he is to propound; to the end, the House in their Debate afterwards may be kept to the Matter of that Question, if the same be approved by the House to contain the substance of the former Debate.</p>
                  <p>After such Question is propounded, any Member may offer his Reasons against that Question in whole or in part, which may be lay'd aside by a general con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of the House without a Question put.</p>
                  <p>But without such general consent no part of the Question propounded may be lay'd aside or omitted; and although the general Debates run against it, vet if any Member, before the Question be put <hi>vvi bout that part,</hi> stand up and desire that such Words or Clause may stand in the Question, before the main Question is put; a Question is to be put, whether those words or such Clause shall stand in the Question.</p>
                  <p>The like Method is observed where any other Alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration is Debated upon, to be made in a Question pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded; but upon putting a Question for such Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, Alteration or Omission, any person who hath formerly spoken to the Matter of the Question, may speak again to shew his Reasons for, or against such Alteration, Addition or Omission, before such Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion be put.</p>

                  <p>When the Speaker (the House calling for a Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion) is putting the same, any Member that hath not before spoken to the Matter, may stand up before the Negative be put.</p>
                  <p>13. <hi>Iunii</hi> 1604. A Bill touching a Subsidy of Ton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage and Poundage having been formerly upon a third Reading recommitted, was returned, and a <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viso</hi> being tendred for <hi>Chester,</hi> which was twice Read, the Question was put for Commitment in the Affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mative: but before the Negative was put, one stood up and spake to it, which was admitted for Orderly, because it is no full Question without the Negative part be put as well as the Affirmative.</p>
                  <p>Every Question is to be put first in the Affirmative: viz. <hi>As many as are of opinion that</hi> (repeating the Words of the Question) <hi>say Yea.</hi> And then the Negative thus: <hi>As many as are of another opinion say No.</hi> To which Question every Member ought to give his Vote one way or other, &amp; the Speaker is to declare his opinion whether the Yea's or the No's have it, which is to stand as the Judgment of the House. But if any Member before any new Motion made, shall stand up and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, That he doth believe the Yea's and No's (as the Cast shall be) have it contrary to the Speaker's Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, then the Speaker is to give direction for the House to Divide, declaring whether the Yea's or the No's are to go forth.</p>
                  <p>Upon the dividing of the House, those are to go forth who are for varying from or against the constant Orders of the House (as that a Question shall not be put, or not be now put, it being the course of the House, that after a Debate the same should be deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined by a Question or the like) or against any posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Order made by the House, or for the passing any new thing, as reading a Petition or Bill, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting, Ingrosing or Passing such a Bill, or the like.</p>
                  <p>10 <hi>Decemb.</hi> 1640. an Order being made the 9. day That the House should be resolved into a Grand Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:175662:22"/> the next day, for Debating the way for Rais<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing Money: Upon the 10. day a Question was upon Debate put, whether the House should be Resolv'd into a Grand Committee; upon which the House was divided, and a Doubt moved which were to go forth. It was declared for a constant Rule, <hi>Those that give their Votes for Preservation of the Orders of the House, should stay in; and those who give their Votes otherwise, to the Introducing any new Matter, or for any Alteration should go forth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>24. <hi>Martii, 21. Jacobi.</hi> Upon a Report from the Committee for Priviledges, a Question was put, That Sir <hi>Tho. Holland</hi> and Sir <hi>John Corbet</hi> were well Elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Knights for <hi>Norfolk;</hi> The House was divided, and a Contest which should go forth; It was over-ruled by the House the <hi>No's</hi> should go forth.</p>
                  <p>Which is also the course upon any Question to agree with a Report in favour of the Opinion of a Committee.</p>
                  <p>Upon dividing the House, the Speaker is to nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate two of those that are in the Affirmative, and two of the Negatives, to count the House; which four (each of them having a Staff in his hand) are to count the number of the Persons who remain sitting in the House, and then to stand within the Door, two on the one side and two on the other, and to count the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of them who went forth as they come in.</p>
                  <p>While the House is thus divided or dividing, no Member may speak, nor (unless it be to go forth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Division) remove out of his place.</p>
                  <p>When the House is thus told, those two of the Tell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers who are of the number of those who have the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor Votes, standing on the right hand, and the two others on the left at the Bar (the rest being all set in their places) are to come from thence up to the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble together, (making the usual Obeysance to the House three times; once at the Bar, again in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of the House, and again when they are come to the Table) And that person who stands on the right
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:175662:22"/> hand, is to declare to the Speaker the number of the <hi>Yeu's</hi> (who sate or went out as the Case is) and of the <hi>No's:</hi> and then with like reverence to depart into their places; after which, Mr. Speaker is to report the same to the House.</p>
                  <p>If the Affirmatives have the major Votes by the judgment of the Speaker, or (in case of division) upon the division, the Clerks is to enter the Vote, <hi>Resolved.</hi> If the Negatives, then he is to enter it thus; The que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion being put (setting down the Words of the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion) It passed in the Negative.</p>
                  <p>Upon the division, if the Members appear to be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual, then the Speaker is to declare his Vote, whether he be a <hi>Yea</hi> or a <hi>No,</hi> which in this Case is the casting Voice; but in other Cases, the Speaker gives no Vote.</p>
                  <p>1. <hi>Maii,</hi> 1606. A question was moved, whether a Man saying <hi>Yea,</hi> might afterwards sit and change his Opinion; and a Precedent was remembred by Mr. Speaker (Sir <hi>Edward Phelips)</hi> of Mr. <hi>Morris</hi> Attorney of the Wards, in 39 <hi>Eliz.</hi> that in like Case changed his Opinion.</p>
                  <p>If upon a Debate it be much controverted, and much be said against the question, any Member may move, That the question may be first made, whether that que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion shall be put, or whether it shall be now put; which usually is admitted at the instance of any Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, especially if it be seconded and insisted on; and if that question being put, it pass in the Affirmative, then the main question is to be put immediately, and no man may speak any thing further to it, either to add or alter: But before the question, whether the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion shall be put, any person who hath not formerly spoken to the main question, hath liberty to speak for it, or against it; because else he shall be precluded from speaking at all to it.</p>
                  <p>If in a Debate there arise more questions then one, and it be controverted which question should be first put; the question first moved and seconded is regularly to be first put, unless it be laid aside by general consent
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:175662:23"/> If the first Question be insisted upon to be put, and the major part seem against it, the Question is to be, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that Question shall be now put: if that pass in the Negative, then the other Question may be put, if de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired: nevertheless, any person may speak to it again before it be put. If in the Affirmative then it is to be put without any addition or alteration, as before: And after that Question is put, if any Member move to have the other Question put, every one hath leave to speak to it again as if it were a new Question.</p>
                  <p>If a Matter be received into Debate, and a Question grow, whether the House shall proceed in that Debate at this time, and it fall out that the House be divided, in such Case the <hi>No's</hi> are to go forth, it being contrary to the course of the House, that any business should be laid aside till it be determined by a Question; If the Question be for an adjournment of a Debate, the <hi>Yea's</hi> are to go forth upon the same reason.</p>
                  <p>After a Question is propounded, no man may speak more than once to the Matter; but having spoken to the Matter, when the Question comes to be put, he may speak to the Manner or Words of the Question, keeping himself to that only, &amp; not ravelling into the Merits of it.</p>
                  <p>If a Question upon a Debate contain more parts then one, and Members seem to be for one part, and not for the other, it may be moved that the same may be divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into two or more Questions: as 2 <hi>Decemb.</hi> 1640. The Debate having been, whether the Election of two Knights for the County of <hi>Warwick</hi> were void; a Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion was put, whether it should be two Questions: and that being Resolved in the Affirmative, the Questions were put severally, upon the Election of the one first and then of the other.</p>
                  <p>No Member in his Discourse in the House may men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the name of any other Member then present, but to describe him by his Title or Addition; as, that Noble <hi>Lord,</hi> Worthy <hi>Knight;</hi> or by his Office, as, <hi>Judge, Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>j<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="19" facs="tcp:175662:23"/> the other side; or thus, the Gentleman that spake last; or last save one, or the like.</p>
                  <p>During any Debate, any Member though he have spoken to the Matter, may rise up and speak to the Orders of the House, if they be transgressed, in case the Speaker do not; but if the Speaker stands up, he is first to be heard, and when he stands up, the other must sit down till the Speaker sit down. But if any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son rise up to speak to the Orders of the House in the midst of a Debate, he must keep within that Line, and not fall into the Matter it self; if he do, he may be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken down by the Speaker, or any other Member, calling to the Orders of the House.</p>
                  <p>Whiles a Member is Speaking to a Debate or Question he is to be heard out and not taken down, unless by Mr. Speaker, in such Cases as you find therein expressed, or that he speak of such Matter as the House doth not think fit to admit.</p>
                  <p>24 <hi>Januar.</hi> 23. <hi>Eliz.</hi> Upon a Debate in the House, Mr. <hi>Carleton,</hi> endeavouring to speak contrary to the Sense of the House, was interrupted; and afterwards offering to speak again, saying with some repetition, That it was for the liberty of the House, the Speaker and the House did stay him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>April.</hi> 1604. Agreed for a Rule of the House, <hi>He that digresseth from the Matter to fall upon the Person, ought to be suppressed by the Speaker.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>17. <hi>April</hi> 1604. Agreed for a general Rule, <hi>If any superfluous Motion or tedious Speech be offered in the House, the party is to be directed and ordered by the Speaker.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. <hi>Maii.</hi> 1610. A Member speaking, and his Speech seeming impertinent, and there being much Hissing and Spitting; It was conceived for a Rule, <hi>That Mr. Speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er may stay impertinent Speeches.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>18. <hi>Maii.</hi> 1604. It was Resolved, That eight in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grossed Bills should be read the next day half an hour af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter eight: The next day about that time, a Member entring into a long discourse <hi>De mera fide &amp; sola fide,</hi> &amp;c. was interrupted, and the Question offered, whether he
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:175662:24"/> should go on in respect of the Order. But it was agreed for a Rule, <hi>If any may speak not to the Matter in Question, the Speaker is to moderate.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>14. <hi>April,</hi> 1604. In a Matter formerly proposed, touching the abuse of the Purveyors, it was argued, Whether it were fittest to proceed by way of Petition to the King or by Bill: which was spoken to by Mr. <hi>Marten,</hi> Mr. <hi>Hoskins</hi> and others, and lastly by Sir <hi>Henry Jenkin,</hi> who was observed to mistake the Question; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (to prevent the idle expence of time) was inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted by Mr. Speaker, and thereupon a Rule concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, <hi>That if any Man speak impertinently or besides the Question in hand, it stands with the Orders of the House for Mr. Speaker to interrupt him, and to know the pleasure of the House, whether they will further hear them</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>In sapientum decretis non est litura.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. <hi>April.</hi> 1604. A Vote having passed some days past, That no Conference should be admitted with the Lords, the same Question was again moved, but was carried in the Negative; And it was then urged for a Rule, That a Question being once made and carried in the Affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive or Negative cannot be questioned again, but must stand as the Judgement of the House.</p>
                  <p>In the Answer of the Commons House of Parliament to King <hi>James</hi> his Objections in Sir <hi>Francis Goodwyn's</hi> Case, 3 <hi>April</hi> 1604. The Objection being, that they refuse Conference with the Lords.</p>
                  <p>The Answer is in these words, Concerning our Refusing Conference with the Lords, there was
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:175662:24"/> none desired untill after our Sentence passed; and then we thought that in a matter private to our own House, <hi>which by Rules of Order might not be by us revoked,</hi> we might without any imputation refuse to confer.</p>

                  <p>A Grand Committee consists of as many Members, at least, as constitute the House (less may not sit or act as a Committee) who have general Powers to consider of any Matters touching the subject Matter re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred, and to present their Opinions therein to the House, the better to prepare Matters of that nature, or Bills therein, for the House; which may better be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, by the liberty that every Member hath in a Grand Committee, as well as in other Committees, to speak more then once to the same Business (if there be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cause) which is not permitted in the House.</p>
                  <p>But Grand Committees have their Powers and Rules, in other Circumstances, given them in express words by the House; as, to send for Witnesses, to hear Council, or assign them on either part, to send for Records; which appears by several Motions made in the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment 21. <hi>Jacobi.</hi> Sir <hi>Robert Phelips</hi> (a person of much Experience in the Course and Orders of Parliament) moved the House from the Grand Committee for Courts of Justice, that they might have Power in the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars aforesaid.</p>

                  <p>When any great business is in agitation that requires much Debate, or a Bill for a publick Tax is to be Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, the House doth use to resolve it self into a Grand Committee of the whole House; which is done by a question, and then the Speaker leaves his Chair: and thereupon the Commitee (which must consist of as great a Number as Constitutes a House, as is before declared) makes choise of a Chair-man, in which case, if more then one be generally called to the Chair, any Member may stand up, and by consent of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee, put a question for one of those named to be the Chair-man.</p>
                  <p>19 <hi>Jacobi,</hi> A dispute being in the Committee, which of two Members named should go to the Chair, the Speaker was called to his Chair, and put the question, That Sir <hi>Edward Coke</hi> (who was one of the persons na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med) should take the Chair, and then the Speaker left his Chair.</p>
                  <p>The Chair-man of the Grand-Committee is to sit in the Clerks place at the Table, and to write the Votes of the Committee.</p>
                  <p>If upon putting a question, the Chair-man (who is to judge by the Voices) have delivered his Opinion that the <hi>Yea</hi>'s have it, and any Member stand up and say, He believes the <hi>No</hi>'s have it, (or contrariwise) the Committee is to divide within the House; the Chair-man directing the <hi>Yea</hi>'s to go that side of the House, that is on the one hand, and the <hi>No</hi>'s to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther side, and then he is to appoint one of each to count the numbers and report them; which is to be done in the same order as in the House, saving that the Obeysance is only twice in the Committee, thrice in the House. If the numbers be equal, the Chair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men hath a casting voice, otherwise he hath no voice in the Committee.</p>
                  <p>When the Committee hath gone through the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter referred to them the Chair-man having read all the Votes, is to put the Question, that the same be reported <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>he House: if that be resolved, He is to
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:175662:25"/> leave the Chair, and the Speaker being again called to the Chair, (or at the next Sitting of the House if it be then adjourned) the Chair-man is to report what hath been resolved at the Committee, standing in his usual place, from whence (if it be not in the seat next the Floor) he is to go down to the Bar, &amp; so to bring up his Report to the Table.</p>
                  <p>If the Committee cannot perfect the business at that Sitting, they may not adjourn as other Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tees; but a Question is to be made for Reporting to the House, and that leave be asked, that the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee may sit at another time on that Business.</p>
                  <p>But if, as some times it falls out, the Matter hath received a full debate in the Committee, and it is judged fit to be resolved in the House, the Speaker is again called to the Chair for that purpose.</p>
                  <p>In other things then as aforesaid, the Rules of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings are to be the same as are in the House.</p>
                  <p>4. <hi>Junii,</hi> 1607. Agreed for a Rule.</p>
                  <p>1. <hi>Every Question upon the voices of a Committee bindeth, and cannot be altered by themselves.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. <hi>Every thing directed and agreed to be Reported, ought to be accordingly Reported; but not every thing spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken or debated at a Committee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>28. <hi>July,</hi> 1641. Declared by the House, that no <hi>Committee ought by Vote to determin the Right or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of the Subject, without first acquainting the House therewith.</hi>

                  <p>17. <hi>May,</hi> 1572. Upon sundry Motions made by divers Members of the House, it was Ordered, That <hi>Ar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>On Monday following, Mr. <hi>Hall</hi> was brought to the Bar by the Serjeant, was charged with several Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, and confessed his folly; and humbly submitted himself to the House, and was remitted.</p>
                  <p>8. <hi>Feb. 1575. P. W.</hi> Esq; one of the Burgesses of <hi>Tregony</hi> in the County of <hi>Cornwal,</hi> was, for unreve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend and undutiful Words uttered by him in the House, touching the Queen, sequestred; that the House might proceed to conference and consideration of his said Speech: upon Debate whereof he was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the Serjeants Ward, as prisoner, and so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining, should be examined upon his said Speech, for extenuating his fault therein.</p>
                  <p>The next day a Report was made of his exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination and confession of the words; he was brought to the Bar by the Serjeant, received this Judgment by the mouth of Mr. Speaker.</p>
                  <p>That he should be committed close prisoner to the Tower, till the House should take further considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion concerning him.</p>
                  <p>4 <hi>Febr.</hi> 1580. Being the third Session of the Fourth Parliament of Queen <hi>Elilabeth</hi> 23 Year of her Reign, complaint was made in the House against <hi>Arthur Hall</hi> Esq; before named, who had caused a Book to be printed, wherein was published the Confercnces of the House; and in it was contained matter of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach against some particular Members of the House,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:175662:27"/> derogatory to the general Authority, Power, and State of the House, and prejudicial to the validity of the proceeding of the same. The matter was refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to a Committee to examine, and upon Report thereof, and bringing the said Mr. <hi>Hall</hi> to the Bar se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral times to Answer; he was sentenced by the House to be committed to the Tower, (as the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son proper to this House) there to remain for the space of six months, and so much longer, as untill he should himself willingly make a Retractation of the said Book, to the satisfaction of the House, or of such Order as the House should make during that Session.</p>
                  <p>That the said <hi>Arthur Hall</hi> should be fined to the Queen Five hundred pounds for his said Offence.</p>
                  <p>That he should be presently severed and cut off from being a Member of this House during this Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, and a Writ to Issue for Election of a new Burgess, for the Borrough of <hi>Grantham</hi> in his stead.</p>
                  <p>That the said Book should be deemed and adjudged false and erroneous.</p>
                  <p>Thereupon, the said Mr. <hi>Hall</hi> was brought to the Bar, unto whom Mr. Speaker, in the name of the whole House pronounced the said Judgement, in form aforesaid; and the Serjeant was commanded to take the charge of him, and to convey him to the Tower, and deliver him to the Lieutenant of the Tower, by Warrant of this House to be signed by the Speaker.</p>
                  <p>18 <hi>March,</hi> 1580. <hi>He</hi> having continued prisoner in the Tower without any Retractation, the House ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed a Committee to allow the said Retractation, and to Report it to the House at the next Session.</p>
                  <p>It appeareth by the Journal 21 <hi>November,</hi> 1586. That he was disabled for ever to serve in Parliament.</p>
                  <p>17. <hi>December,</hi> 1584. A Bill against Jesuits and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minary Priests passed upon the Question: Dr. <hi>P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="27" facs="tcp:175662:27"/> while the House was in Debate of that business. After wards he was brought to the Bar, and there kneeling was told by the Speaker, if he thought fit the House was content to hear his Reasons; but he refusing was committed to the Serjeants Ward.</p>
                  <p>The next day he was brought to the Bar, and kneel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, confessed he had undutifully behaved himself; and rashly and unadvisedly utterred those Speeches he had used; and was with all his heart, very sorry for it: Alledging withal he had never been of the House till that Session, and so could not so well know the Orders of the House as he should do; and that he would not henceforth willingly offend the House, nor any one man in it; and so humbly prayed for their good favour toward him. Whereupon, being again sequestered out of the House, after some Arguments and Debates, it was Resolved, upon this acknowledgment of his fault, and his humble submission he should be received into the House again, as a Member thereof, and take his place as before, so that he would still afterwards be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have himself in good sort as he ought to do: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon being called again to the Bar, and there kneeling, directly reiterating his former Confession of his fault, and humble submission, with promises of better de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanor, he was admitted.</p>
                  <p>13. <hi>Feb.</hi> 1606. Upōn a Report made in the House, of the Remembrances formerly set down of the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars of a Conference, the Speaker offering to read the Paper, and being interrupted by some Motions and Disputes, whether they should be Read one by one and so Debated. or all at once: In that difference, one of the Knights for <hi>Buckingham-shire,</hi> with a loud voice (not standing up bare-headed as the Order is) pressed to have them Read. The House observing his earnestness, and manner of sitting and Calling, for Orders-sake urged him to stand up and speak. He stood up, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to offer some Reasons, fell into an Invective a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the <hi>Scots,</hi> much distasting the House; yet out of a common care to expedit the Weighty Business then
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:175662:28"/> in hand, his Speech was neglected without Tax of Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure.</p>
                  <p>But on <hi>Monday</hi> following it was remembered, and his Words of offence recited in particular, the Gentleman being absent, was sent for by the Serjeant.</p>
                  <p>Touching the manner of Proceeding in this Case, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Motions and Questions were Moved. As, 1. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to name a Committee to consider wherewith to charge him. 2. Whether to censure him upon their own knowledge, without other Circumstances, the fault be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing apparent. 3. Whether to charge him in general, or with the particular Words. Much was said upon these Questions <hi>pro</hi> and <hi>contra,</hi> and the Precedents of <hi>Parry</hi> and <hi>Throckmorton</hi> remembred wherein for words spoken in the House, the Proceedings was by the House, and not by Committee; the Offences generally charged, and punished, and the Words put in Oblivion: and so in this Case, the Judgment and Proceeding resolv'd to be accordingly.</p>
                  <p>The Serjeant having brought the Offender; it was moved he might be heard at the Bar, which was assent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto; and after he had spoken, he was Commanded to retire; and not long after, was called in again, to the Bar, where kneeling, Mr. Speaker acquainted him, since the Offence was so apparently heinous, the House did not hold it fit, that any particulars should be na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, or to give any reason of their Judgment; but the Order was, He would be carried to the prison of the Tower, and there remain during the pleasure of the House: &amp; that he should be dismissed from his place of Knight of the Shire <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>or <hi>Bucks,</hi> and a new Writ to issue for a new choice.</p>
                  <p>15. <hi>Febr. 18. Jacobi.</hi> A Bill being read the second time <hi>for the better observation of the Sabbath:</hi> one of the Members made an Invective against it, and something which seemed to reflect on a Member of the House, who presented it, as savouring of a Puritan and a Factious spirit. Exceptions were taken at the Words. After he had explained himself, he was Ordered to withdraw
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:175662:28"/> out of the House; and a Debate being had, he was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to the Bar, and upon his knees, he received the Judgement of the House, pronounced by the Speaker. That he should be discharged from the service of the House; with an Intimation, that his Judgement was very merciful, for that the House might for so exorbitant an Offence, have Imprisoned and further punished him.</p>
                  <p>3. <hi>April.</hi> 1604. In a Debate upon a Bill, a Member of the House uttered some Speeches highly distasting the House: but no notice was taken of it till the Bill was committed, &amp; then the Words being repeated, he was call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Bar, where he made his excuse, &amp; was pardoned.</p>
                  <p>26. <hi>April.</hi> 1641. Great Offence was taken by the House at words spoken by Mr. <hi>J. H.</hi> He was first heard to to explain himself, and then commanded to withdraw, and was called to the Bar and suspended the House du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that Session of Parliament.</p>
                  <p>27. <hi>May,</hi> 1631. A Paper was brought in containing words spoken by Mr. <hi>Taylor</hi> a Member of the House con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the passing the Bill of Attainder of the Earl of <hi>Strafford:</hi> who being heard to explain himself, and then commanded to withdraw; after some Debate in the House, it was resolved, That he should be expelled the House; be made uncaple of ever being a Member of this House; and should <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>orthwith be Committed pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner to the Tower, there to remain during the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of the House; and should make an acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his Offence, both at the Bar and at <hi>Windsor</hi> pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly. And he was called to the Bar, and there kneel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Mr. Speaker pronounced the Sentence accordingly.</p>
                  <p>Of later times it hath been observed, as most condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing to the Service of the House, that if in Debate words be let fall that give offence, exceptions should be taken the same day, and before such Member go out of the House; or he who is offended may move, that such per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son may not go out of the House until he hath given satisfaction in what was by him spoken. And in such Case, after the present Debate is over, the words must be repeated by the Persons excepting; And in Case he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:175662:29"/> or the House command him, he is to explain him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, standing in his place, which if he refuse to do, or the House be not satisfy'd with such explanation, then he is to withdraw: But neither is this to interrupt the present business of the House, as in the Cases before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned; or if be omitted that day, hath it been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>called afterwards to avoid mistakes, and out of a wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingness rather to pass by, then take occasion of offence.</p>
                  <p>13. <hi>May, 12. Jacobi.</hi> Upon report of the Amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the Bill for the due Observation of the Sabbath day, complaint was made the same Indignity was offered to Sr. <hi>R. Owen,</hi> when he was in the Chair at the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee, by Sir <hi>W. H.</hi> that told him he was Partial; and by Sir <hi>R. K.</hi> who took him by the hand, and told him, he would pull him out of the Chair, that he should put no more tricks upon the House.</p>
                  <p>Sir <hi>W. H.</hi> being present, made an acknowledgment of his Error, which upon the Question was taken for a good satisfaction.</p>
                  <p>Sir <hi>R. K.</hi> was Ordered by the House to acknowledge his Error at the Bar.</p>
                  <p>19 <hi>Jacobi,</hi> Some Speeches passing in the House pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately between two of the Members, and some offence taken, which seems was not intended to be given; one of them in going down the Parliament stairs struck the other; who thereupon catched at a sword then in his mans hand to strike with it. Upon complaint made of it to the House, they were both of them ordered to attend the House. Being come, he who gave the blow was called in, and standing (not at the Bar, but) by the Bar, was examined by Mr. Speaker; confessed the giving the blow, insisted on the provocation, and withdrew. The other was also called in, to relate the truth. After he had made the relation, and was likewise withdrawn, &amp; testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony given by a Member of the House who heard the words the House proceeded to Sentence against Mr. <hi>C.</hi> who struck the blow: he being brought to the Bar, there on his knees he receved Judgement, which was pronounced by the Seaker That he should be committed to the Tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er during the pleasure of the House.</p>

                  <p>THere are two ends of Calling the House.</p>
                  <p>1. To discover whether any were in the House, who are not returned by the Clerk of the Crown in Chancery; it having been accounted a great Crime, and severely punished.</p>
                  <p>5. <hi>Martii.</hi> 1557. In the Parliament held 4 <hi>&amp; 5 Phil. &amp; Mariae,</hi> I find this Entry.</p>
                  <p>For that <hi>Christopher Perne</hi> affirmed, that he is return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Burgess for <hi>Plimpton,</hi> in <hi>Devon,</hi> and hath brought no Warrant thereof to the House, nor is returned hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the Clerk of the Crown, by Book or Warrant; he is awarded to be in the custody of the Serjeant, till the House have farther considered.</p>
                  <p>It appears by that Book afterwards, that he was cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen a Burgess, and admitted.</p>
                  <p>2. <hi>January,</hi> 1562. In the second Parliament of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> For that it seemed to the House, being very full, that there were a greater number then was return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; therefore the Names were immediately called over and as they were called, departed out of the House.</p>
                  <p>7 <hi>Febr.</hi> 1588. The House was called, and every one answered to his name, and departed out of the House as they were called.</p>
                  <p>2 But chiefly the Calling the House, is to discover what Members are absent without leave of the House, or just cause; in which case, Fines have been imposed. And on this occasion, if the House be called, the manner hath been to call over the Names, and each Member to stand up at the mention of his name, uncovering his head.

                  <p>Some question hath been touching the time in which the Priviledge is to be allowed, and the manner how it is to be obtained.</p>
                  <p>For the first, the Precedents are very numerous for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing <hi>Priviledge</hi> during the Session.</p>
                  <p>1.

Thomas Enny</hi>'s Burgess for the Borough of <hi>Tusk</hi> complained that a <hi>Supoena</hi> was delivered him to appear in Chancery, and required the priviledge of the House; whereupon Sir <hi>Clement Higham</hi> and Mr. Recorder of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> were sent to the L. Chancellor to revoke the Process.</p>
                     <p>And albeit an Entry is made in the Journal 10 <hi>Febru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arii, 1584. 26. Elizabeth,</hi> that upon Motion made touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Opinion of the House for Priviledge, in case of a <hi>Subpoena</hi> served out of the Chancery upon Mr. <hi>Richard Cook</hi> a Member of the House: It was Ordered that the Recorder of <hi>London,</hi> and two other Members of the House attended by the Serjeant, should repair presently in the name of the whole House into the body of the Court of Chancery, and there to signify to the Lord Chancellor and master of the Rolls, That by the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Liberties of this House, the Members of the same are priviledged from being served with <hi>Subpaena's:</hi> and to require withal, not only the discharge of Mr. <hi>Cook's</hi> Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, but from thenceforth to grant Priviledge for other Members, upon the request of the House signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed under the Speaker's hand: which Mr. Recorder and the rest did accordingly. But they return this Answer, That the Lord Chancellor told them, he knew no such Priviledge touching <hi>Subpoena</hi>'s, and would not allow it,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:175662:31"/> unless the House did prove it had been allowed also in that Court of Chancery: whereupon Precedents were directed to be viewed; but within few days after the Parliament ended.</p>

                     <p>1 <hi>Jacobi,</hi> The first day of sitting, complaint was made, That Sir <hi>Thomas Shirley</hi> chosen a Member of the House, was arrested four days before the sitting of this Parliament; a Warrant issued to the Clerk of the Crown for a <hi>Habeas corpus,</hi> to bring him to the House being then prisoner in the Fleet; and the Serjeant and his Yeoman were sent for in custody, who being brought to the Bar, and confessing their fault, were remitted for that time: The Writ being not executed, the House fell again into Debate touching the priviledge, and how the Debt to the party might be satisfied because the Debt was gone if the party were delivered; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon came to three Questions:</p>
                     <p>1. Whether Sir <hi>Thomas Shirley</hi> shall have priviledge.</p>
                     <p>2. Whether presently, or to be deferred till further Order.</p>
                     <p>3. Whether the House should be petitioners to the King, according to former Precedents, for some course, for securing the Debt to the party, and saving harmless the Warden of the <hi>Fleet.</hi> All which Questions were resolved in the Affirmative, and a Bill drawn to secure <hi>Simpsons</hi> Debt, &amp;c. which also produced a Bill for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of Plantiffs in Writs of Execution, where the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendants in such Writs are arrested, and set at liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty by priviledge of Parliament.</p>

It was Ordered, That <hi>Simpson</hi> at whose Suit, and the Serjeant by whom the Arrest was made, should be committed to the Tower.</p>
                     <p>4. <hi>May</hi> following, an <hi>Habeas Corpus</hi> was awarded to the Warden, to bring Sir <hi>Thomas Shirley</hi> to the House; the Warden denied to execute it, for which 7. <hi>May</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, he was sent for by the Serjeant, and brought to the Bar, who denying to bring his prisoner, a new Writ of <hi>Habeas Corpus</hi> was awarded, and the Warden was committed to the Serjeant, with this, That if that Writ were not executed, then he should be delivered over to the Lieutenant of the Tower, as the House's pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner.</p>
                     <p>8 <hi>May,</hi> The Serjeant was sent with his Mace to the <hi>Fleet,</hi> the House sitting, to require the Body of Sir <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Shirley,</hi> being directed by the House to pursue the Precedent of <hi>Ferrers,</hi> recorded in <hi>Hollingshead</hi>'s Chroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, and in the Book of Jurisdiction of Courts by <hi>Cromp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton:</hi> but the Serjeant being denied, a Warrant was made to the Serjeant, to deliver the Warden of the <hi>Fleet</hi> to the Lieutenant of the Tower, to be keptclose prisoner.</p>
                     <p>11 <hi>May,</hi> The Warden was again sent for, and brought to the Bar, and refusing to deliver up his prisoner, he was committed to the place called the Dungeon, or lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle-ease, in the Tower.</p>
                     <p>14 <hi>May,</hi> A new Warrant was ordered for a new Writ of <hi>Habeas Corpus,</hi> and that the Serjeant should go with the Writ; that the Warden should be brought to the Door of the <hi>Fleet</hi> by the Lieutenant himself; and there the Writ to be delivered to him, and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment of the House to be made known to him by the Serjeant, for the Executing of it. That in the mean

                     <p>18. <hi>May,</hi> The Warden did deliver Sir <hi>Thomas Shir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley,</hi> and so was not put into the Dungeon.</p>
                     <p>19. <hi>May,</hi> He attending at the door, was brought in to the Bar, where, upon his Knees, confessing his er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror and presumption, and professing he was unseignedly sorry he had so offended this Honourable House; Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that submission, by direction of the House, the Speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er pronounced his pardon and discharge, paying ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Fees to the Clerk and the Serjeant.</p>
                     <p>That this priviledge doth take place by force of Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and that before the Return be made, appears by the proceeding in the Case following.</p>

                     <p>6. <hi>March,</hi> 1586. This day <hi>William White</hi> brought
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:175662:36"/> to the Bar, for arresting Mr. <hi>Martin,</hi> a Member of the House, That the Arrest was above fourteen days be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the beginning of the Parliament: the House there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon appointed a Committee to search the Precedents.</p>
                     <p>Upon Report made, that Mr. <hi>Martin</hi> was arrested a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove twenty days of the beginning of the Parliament, held by prorogation; and upon Debate, the House be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing divided in opinion about the priviledge; for the ending of the business, three Questions were propound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Speaker.</p>
                     <p>1. Whether the House would limit a time certain, or a Reasonable time, to any Member of the House for his priviledge?</p>
                     <p>The House answered, <hi>A Convenient time.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>2. Whether Mr. <hi>Martin</hi> was arrested within this Convenient time?</p>
                     <p>The House answered, <hi>Yea.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>3. If <hi>White</hi> should be punished for arresting Mr. <hi>Martin?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The House answered, <hi>No.</hi> And the reason is given, Because the arrest was twenty days before the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Parliament, and the Creditors did not know what should be taken for a Reasonable time.</p>
                     <p>24. <hi>April.</hi> 1640. It was this day said in the House, and not contradicted, that every Member of the House hath priviledge for sixteen days <hi>exclusive,</hi> and fifteen days <hi>inclusive,</hi> before and after every Parliament.</p>
